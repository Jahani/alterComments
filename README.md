## About Google Sidewiki (Discontinued)
Google Sidewiki was a web annotation tool from Google, launched in September 2009 and discontinued in December 2011.
Sidewiki was a browser extension that allowed anyone logged into a Google Account to make and view comments about a given website in a sidebar.
Despite the name, the tool was not a collaborative wiki, though the comments were editable by the author.
